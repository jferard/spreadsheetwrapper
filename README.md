## Goal
 The goal of SpreasheetWrapper is to provide an abstraction layer over some APIs used to write spreadsheet documents (POI, odftoolkit, ...). It's useful when you can't choose which API will be embedded in the jar.

## Installation
```
$> mkdir spreadsheetwrapper-parent
$> git clone https://github.com/jferard/spreadsheetwrapper
$> mvn clean install
```
